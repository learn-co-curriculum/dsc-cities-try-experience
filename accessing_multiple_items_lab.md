# Accessing Multiple Items in a List  - Lab

## Objectives for this lesson

***

* Practice selecting multiple items from a list using a range of indices
* Select multiple items with slicing
* Create a new list from a slice of the original list

In this lesson we will practice slicing elements of a list.  In the code console below, we have loaded the list `top_travel_cities` for you.  We will use slicing to select the the desired sections of the list in the instructions below.

## Try it out

***

In the code console below, type in the code below to see the result of the slice it returns.

```python
top_travel_cities[0:3]

top_travel_cities[3:7]
```
>**Level up** - try choosing some slices of your own.  Think about what cities you would like to get and write the code to select just those cities.
