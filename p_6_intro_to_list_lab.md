# The `list` data type - Lab

## Objectives for this lesson

***

* In this lab, you will practice what you've learned about lists using an interactive code console.

## Try it out

***

In the code console below, we have declared a variable, `top_travel_cities` and set it equal to a list of the top travel cities. Try typing the variable name so you can see the output.  
- <p>Remember to click the <mark style="color:green; background:none; font-weight:bold">green</mark> arrow to initialize the console.</p> 
> **Level up:** Try creating your own list.  create a list of names or places and assign them to a variable.
