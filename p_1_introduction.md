# Top travel cities

## Exploring Lists with Travel Cities  

***

As you already know from living in the digital age, programming is a very powerful tool for answering questions about data. It allows you to collect, clean and format data and then perform calculations on that data. Much of the digital information is in the form of _text_. You can ask questions with text and get answers in text. 

Imagine someone asks you what your top 10 list of favorite restaurants is?  How about your favorite cars, or the fastest motorcycles?  The answer you give to this question would most likely be in text, and if you wanted to store this information using a programming language (say, Python), the best way for you to format your text answer is in the form of a _list_.  These top 10 lists are usually organized in an ordered list of text items. If this doesn't make sense yet, don't worry, you'll soon learn all about it!

In this short course, you will explore how Python can help you to organize a list and help you to access different components of the list using different criteria. You will dive into the characterictics of the `list` data type using a list of top travel cities from the popular magazine *Travel and Leisure*.  After you have explored the `list` data type, you will put your new knowledge into practice and map out these top cities on a map.
