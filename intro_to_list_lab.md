# Introduction to Lists Lab

## The **list** `list` data type - Lab

***

## Objectives for this lesson

***

* In this lab, we will practice what we have learned about lists using an interactive code console.

## Interactive code console

***

>Throughout this module in sections titled **Try it out**, you will encounter interactive code consoles that allow you to run Python code. **Click the green arrow at the top of a console window to initialize it** as shown below.  Then you can run the pre-written code or practice writing any code you want and see the result. Some of the consoles will have code pre-written for you, while others will ask you to write your own code.

## Try it out

***

In the code console below, we have declared a variable, `top_travel_cities` and set it equal to a list of the top travel cities. Try typing the variable name so you can see the output.  
> **Level up:** Try creating your own list.  create a list of names or places and assign them to a variable.

## Recap

***

Great! Now that we have seen how a list can be created and stored, let's look at how we can access the elements of the list so we can use it.
