# Congratulations!!

## Wrap-up

***

## Good job, you got through the whole course!  
Throughout this course you were introduced to many of the fundamentals of Python and have made progress on your path to becoming a data scientist.  Let's review some of the key topics you learned in this course:

- You learned about some of the data types used in Python such as:
    - _strings_, which you learned is any text and can be numbers, letters or symbols
    - _integers_, which you discovered can be any whole number either positive or negative
    - _floats_, which are similar to integers but have decimal points
    - _booleans_, wehich you learned are for testing whether something is true or false

- You learned about some different data structures like the _list_:
    - how it can be an ordered collection of any combination of different data types
    - how to access the elements of a list with _indexing_
    - selecting sections of a list using _slicing_
    - manipulating lists using different Python tools like:
        - `.append()` to add elements
        - `.pop()` to remove elements
    - learning the length of a list with `len()`
    - creating a set of unique elements with `set()`

- Finally, you had the opportunity to work on a mini project which walked you through a simple example of how Python can be used to clean and analyze a simple data set and create some visualizations from the data to help get a better idea of the relationship of the elements in the data.
