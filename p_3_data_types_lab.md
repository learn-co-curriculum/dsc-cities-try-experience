# Python Data Types - Lab

## Objectives for this lesson

***

* Practice testing the data dype of data
* Use the `type()` function

Now that we have learned about the different types of data and how to check what type of data we are working with, let's take this chance to practice using this new knowledge.

## Interactive code console

***

Throughout this module you will encounter our interactive code console, which you will use to practice writing the code you will learn in the lessons. This code console allows you to write and run code so you can see the results for yourself. 

To use the console, you'll first need to **initialize the console by clicking the green arrow**, as indicated by the arrow in the illustration below.

Once you have initialized the code console, you will be able to see the output of the provided code as well as type any commands or code as instructed in the material. You can type your code at the prompt as shown in the illustration below.

## Try it out

***

Let's use the `type()` function on a few different types of data to really see how it works. Here are a few different types of data to try in this function so you can see the result. We have loaded the data and set each one equal to a variable so you can see how it works when assigned to a variable.

```python
item_1 = "Las Vegas"
item_2 = 73
item_3 = 3.14159
item_4 = (7 == 4)
item_5 = (4 >= 7)

```
Pass the above variable names as an argument to the `type()` function one at a time in the code console below and take note of the result.  

- <p>Remember to click the <mark style="color:green; background:none; font-weight:bold">green</mark> arrow to initialize the console.</p>  
>**Level up** - Try entering your own data as an argument to the `type()` function.  Try assigning the data to a variable, and then passing it to the `type()` function.

## Recap

***

Now that we understand how to use the `type()` function and check the type of data we are working with, we can use this data to create a **list**.
