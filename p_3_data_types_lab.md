# Python Data Types - Lab

## Objectives for this lesson

***

* Practice testing the data dype of data
* Use the `type()` function

Now that we have learned about the different types of data and how to check what type of data we are working with, let's take this chance to practice using this new knowledge.

## Interactive code console

***

Throughou, you will use these to practice writing the code you will learn in this module. This code console allows you to write and run code so you can see the results for yourself. To use the console, you'll first need to **initialize the console by clicking the green arrow**, indicated by the arrow in the illustration below. Once you have initialized the code console, you will be able to view the provided code as well as type any commands or code at the prompt as instructed in the material.

## Try it out

***

Let's use the `type()` function on a few different types of data to really see how it works. Here is are a few different types of data to try in this function so you can see the result. We have loaded the data and set each one equal to a variable so you can see how it works when assigned to a variable.

```python
"Las Vegas"
73
3.14159
(7 == 4)
(4 >= 7)

```
Pass the above data as an argument to the `type()` function and take note of the result.  Run the code console below to see the result of the code above.  Click on the green arrow to run it.
>**Level up** - Try entering your own data as an argument to the `type()` function.  Try assigning the data to a variable, and then passing it to the `type()` function.

## Recap

***

Now that we understand how to use the `type()` function and check the type of data we are working with, we can use this data to create a **list**.
