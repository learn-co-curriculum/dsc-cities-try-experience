* Check the length of a list with the `len()` function
* Create a set of unique elements from a list
* Convert a set back to a list

## Checking the length of a list with the `len()` function

***

Knowing the length of a list can be useful when you are working with data.  In the code console below, we have defined `top_travel_cities`.  Check the length of this list using the `len()` function. 

## Try it out

***

In the code console below, check the length of the list using the `len()` function.  Pass the name of our list `top_travel_cities` as an argument to the function to see how many elements are in our list.
>**Level up** - create your own list and check the length of your list.  Add an item or two and see how this affects the output of the `len()` function.

## Create a set of unique elements from a list

***

The ability to get a list of the individual, or unique elements in a list is very useful.  In our list, we have mistakenly added some duplicates.  Let's get a set of the unique elements in our list so we can use it to determine which elements have duplicates.  Let's assign our new set of unique destinations to a variable, `top_cities_set` using the `set()` function.

## Try it out

***

In the code console below, pass the list name `top_travel_cities` to the `set()` function and assign it to the variable `top_cities_set`
>**Level up** - try adding more duplicates to the list to see if it affects the outcome of this process. Check the data type of each variable and try to change the set back to a list so it is easier to work with.

## Recap

***

In this lesson, you used the `len()` function to count the elements in the list.  You also used the `set()` function to get a set of the unique values in the list and converted the set back to a list to make it easier to use.
