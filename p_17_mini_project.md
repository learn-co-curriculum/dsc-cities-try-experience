# Mini Project

## Graphing cities

***

With our new knowldge of how a `list` works in python, we have a little project to work on.  Click on the link below and you will be taken to a Google Colab notebook. This notebook is very similar to a Jupyter notebook which is the format you will be learning in the Data Science program at Flatiron School.

The notebook you are taken to is a read only version, you will need to save a copy to your account so you can work with it and make changes and run the cells.  Once you have gone through the whole project, go back and change up some of the lists and functions to practice what you have learned.

Happy coding!!
