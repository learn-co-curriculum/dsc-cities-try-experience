# Mini Project

## Graphing cities

***

With our new knowldge of how a `list` works in python, we have a little project to work on.  Click on the link below and you will be taken to a Google Colab notebook. This notebook is very similar to a Jupyter notebook which is the format you will be learning in the Data Science program at Flatiron School.

Click on the link below to see this for yourself.  The link will take you to a read only version of a notebook that you can then save a copy and try changing some of the code to see how it affects the output.  

> This notebook is in Google Colab which is an online IDE (Integrated Development Environment), in this IDE you can edit and run code, as well as save the notebook and make changes.  You will need to sign in to your Google account or create one.  

### Remember, once you are done, return to this lesson to complete it.

Happy coding!!
