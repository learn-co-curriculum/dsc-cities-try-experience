## Objectives for this lesson

***

* Practice testing the data dype of data
* Use the `type()` function

Now that we have learned about the different types of data and how to check what type of data we are working with, let's take this chance to practice using this new knowledge.

## Try it out

***

Let's use the `type()` function on a few different types of data to really see how it works. Here is are a few different types of data to try in this function so you can see the result. We have loaded the data and set each one equal to a variable so you can see how it works when assigned to a variable.

```python
"Las Vegas"
73
3.14159
(7 == 4)
(4 >= 7)

```
Pass the above data as an argument to the `type()` function and take note of the result.  Run the code console below to see the result of the code above.  Click on the green arrow to run it.
>**Level up** - Try entering your own data as an argument to the `type()` function.  Try assigning the data to a variable, and then passing it to the `type()` function.

## Recap

***

Now that we understand how to use the `type()` function and check the type of data we are working with, we can use this data to create a **list**.
