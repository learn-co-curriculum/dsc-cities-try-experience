## Graphing cities

***

Ok, so now that we have a sense of how to read from and alter a list in Python, let's see how our knowledge of lists can help us in creating data visualizations in Python.

## Working with lists and maps

As we know, lists are used to store a collection of data.  In describing a city, we can use lists to organize our data in all sorts of ways.  For example, here is a list of neighborhoods in the city of Buenos Aires.


Assign the variable `palermo` to the first element of the `neighborhoods` list.


```python
palermo = None
```

Now assign the variable `la_boca` to the last element of our list.
