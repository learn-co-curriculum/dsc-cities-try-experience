# Accessing Single Items in a List  - Lab

## Objectives for this lesson

***

* Select individual items from a list using the index
* Index from the beginning
* Index from the end

## Indexing

***

In this lesson, we will practice accessing list elements using the index from the beginning and the end, and we will try assigning a single item to a variable using the index.


## Try it out

***

Run the code console below to see the result of printing the item referenced by this line of code `top_travel_cities[0]`. We have the list `top_travel_cities` defined for you.
>**Level Up** - try to access the others youself by using the same command but replacing the index with any other number between 0 and 11.

So from our lesson, we know that we can access items with either positive or negative indices.  Let's practce using the negative index to access items from the end of our list `top_travel_cities`. If we want to access the last item in the list with the index of `[-1]` we would code it like this:

```python
top_travel_cities[-1]
```

## Try it out

***

In the code console below, try to access the the last item by typing the command `top_travel_cities[-1]`.  
>**Level Up** -  choose a city in the list and try to access it using the index from the end of the list.

## Recap

***

Now that we know how to access a single item in a list, let's take a look at how to select multiple items from the list as a chunk or **slice**
